This is a Java program that performs math calculations using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It organizes code into different classes for easier reuse and maintenance.

File Structure (Classes)
MathOperation.java (Parent Class): Holds the shared result variable.

Arithmetic.java: Handles Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.

Geometry.java: Calculates Area and Perimeter for Circles and Rectangles.

NumberAnalysis.java: Checks for Prime numbers, Even/Odd, and Factorials.

Main.java: The runner class that tests the library.

OOP Concepts Used
Inheritance: All math classes extend MathOperation to reuse code.

Encapsulation: All data (like radius or number) is private.
